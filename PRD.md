## Executive Summary

Faithful Archive is a Dioxus-based web application for uploading and sharing Christ-honoring spiritual content on Arweave's permanent storage network. By leveraging Rust's performance and WebAssembly compilation, the platform ensures fast, secure access to sermons, worship resources, and Bible studies that remain accessible "for 100+ years."

This implementation represents a modern approach to decentralized spiritual content archiving, combining Rust's memory safety with Dioxus's reactive UI framework. The platform focuses on content curation, community moderation, and global accessibility while maintaining the permanence guarantees of blockchain storage.

**Ultimate Vision:** Build performant, secure technology that empowers purposeful, God-centered living by preserving faithful resources in a free, immutable archive—combating digital ephemerality and promoting spiritual growth through cutting-edge web technologies.

## Target Audience and Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Content Creators:** Pastors, worship leaders, and Bible teachers uploading sermons (audio/video + notes), sheet music/lyrics, and study guides
- **Consumers:** Believers seeking ad-free, trustworthy resources for personal or group study
- **Global Missionaries:** Users in restricted areas needing censorship-resistant access
- **Tech-Savvy Church Staff:** Administrators comfortable with modern web applications

### Core Use Cases
1. **Pastor uploads sermon with metadata:** Audio/video file with transcript, Scripture references, and series information—reviewed, approved, and indexed for search
2. **Worship team shares resources:** Chord charts and lyrics uploaded with proper tagging for easy discovery
3. **Global content access:** User searches "Romans grace study" and streams content via optimized WASM player
4. **Content moderation:** Reviewers use efficient dashboard to approve/reject submissions with clear workflow
5. **Offline preparation:** PWA capabilities allow content downloading for areas with limited connectivity

---

## Content Policy and Moderation

To ensure only Christ-honoring content is surfaced:
- **Policy Foundation:** All uploads must align with core Christian doctrines (e.g., Nicene Creed) and avoid hate, blasphemy, or heresy
- **Moderation Layers:**
  - Whitelisted uploaders (vetted via application process)
  - Pre-publish review queue with efficient WASM-powered interface
  - Community flagging system for post-publish oversight
  - AI-assisted content analysis for initial screening
- **Arweave Integration:** While data is permanent on-chain, the frontend only indexes approved transaction IDs—effectively "hiding" non-compliant content from discovery

---
